**How It Works:**

**HTML File:** It contains the structure of the webpage, with a header for navigation, a section for main content, and a footer.

**CSS File:** This file contains the styles for the page, including layout, colors, typography, and hover effects.

**Linking the CSS File:** The link tag in the head section of the HTML file links the styles.css file, ensuring the page uses the styles defined there.

**To see the webpage:**

Save the HTML code in a file named index.html.
Save the CSS code in a file named styles.css in the same directory as index.html.
Open index.html in any web browser.
